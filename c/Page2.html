        <p>Michael Kors has had an affinity for fashion since he was very young. His mother thought it may have had to something to do with the fact that he was exposed to the apparel industry through her modeling career. As a teen, Michael began designing clothes and selling them out of his parents’ basement which he renamed the Iron Butterfly.[9] In 1977, he enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.[10] However, he dropped out after only nine months and took at job at a boutique across from Bergdorf on 57th Street where he was given a small space to sell his designs. Shorty after, Dawn Mello, the former fashion director at Bergdorf Goodman, discovered Michael. She asked if he would show his collection to Bergdorf Goodman’s buyers and he has had his collection ever since.[11] In 1981, Kors launched the Michael Kors womenswear line at Bloomingdales, Bergdorf Goodman, Lord & Taylor, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue. Building on his success, Kors was named the first ever women's ready-to-wear designer and creative director for the French fashion house Celine in 1997. In his tenure at Celine, Kors turned the fashion house around with blockbuster accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line. Kors left Celine in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand. Kors launched his menswear line in 2002. In addition to the Michael Kors runway collection, the MICHAEL Michael Kors and KORS Michael Kors lines were launched in 2004. KORS is considered the mid-tier line, between the runway and MICHAEL collections. The MICHAEL line includes women's handbags and shoes as well as women's ready-to-wear apparel. The KORS line contains footwear and Jeans. Currently, Kors has full collection boutiques in New York, Beverly Hills, Palm Beach, Manhasset, and Chicago. 2011 marked Michael Kors' thirtieth year in business.
Among the celebrities who have worn Michael Kors' designs are Jennifer Lopez, Rachel McAdams, Elissa, Heidi Klum, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.[citation needed] Michelle Obama wore his black sleeveless dress in her first term official portrait as First Lady.[12] Joan Allen wore his gown when she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the The Contender. In addition, Jennifer Garner wore a custom creation as an Academy Award presenter in 2006. As Creative Director of Celine, Michael Kors designed many outfits for actresses to wear on screen, including Gwyneth Paltrow in Possession;[13] and Rene Russo in The Thomas Crown Affair.[14] One of his gowns was worn by Alicia Keys for her performance at Barack Obama's inaugural ball on January 21, 2013.[15]
The ad campaigns for Michael Kors often reflects the jet-set sportswear that Kors fans are fond of. Previous campaigns include the model Carmen Kass on the tarmac of an airport, on a safari in Africa, and relaxing on a yacht.
Kors was a judge on the Emmy-nominated reality television program Project Runway, which aired on Bravo for five seasons; subsequent seasons aired on Lifetime. On December 18, 2012 it was announced that Kors would be leaving Project Runway, to be replaced by fellow designer Zac Posen.</p>
